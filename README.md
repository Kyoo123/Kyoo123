🔒 Firewalls & Access Control Lists (ACL) Project

Project link: [nwt.voidcore.dev](https://vdc.re/nwt-solo)

This project, developed during the 2024/25 school year, focuses on the implementation and simulation of network security concepts, including firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), VLAN segmentation, and DHCP configuration.

The design was created and tested using Cisco Packet Tracer, with detailed documentation prepared in Notion. The project is publicly hosted via Notion and GitHub Pages.

Key technologies and equipment:

    3 × Cisco 1941 routers

    4 × Cisco Catalyst 2650-24PS switches

    3 × Cisco Packet Tracer servers

    24 × Cisco Packet Tracer PCs

Objectives and outcomes:

    Configure and test ACLs to control traffic between VLANs

    Implement firewall rules for network security

    Set up DHCP for dynamic IP address assignment

    Document design decisions and configurations in a structured and accessible format
